# DBD Map Detector

A simple program that displays an overlay of every map you load into on
**Dead by Daylight**.

## üß© How It Works

The program scans the name of the map that appears at the bottom of the
screen when you press **ESC** in a game. It then shows the corresponding
map image as an overlay on your screen.

I made a quick tutorial here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeXosj2a50

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Launch** `DbdMapDetector.exe` (DbdMapDetector\bin\Debug\DbdMapDetector.exe)
2.  **Start** a Dead by Daylight match
3.  When in-game, **press `Esc` and then `F3`**
    -   A map should appear in the **top-left** of your screen.
4.  For maps with **multiple variations**, the program can't detect them
    precisely (since the variation name isn't displayed).
    -   Use **`F1`** to switch between variations manually until you
        find the right one.
5.  In the program window, you can **adjust the size, opacity, and
    position** of the map overlay.
6.  When your game ends, press **`F2`** to hide the map.

## üó∫Ô∏è Maps Folder

-   The maps displayed are from **Hens333**, stored in the `Maps`
    folder.\
-   You can replace these with your own maps if you prefer.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

-   Custom map images **must be `.jpg` files**.
-   The filenames **must match exactly** the ones provided, or the
    program **won't work**.
